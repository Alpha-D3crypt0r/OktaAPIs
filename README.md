# OktaAPIs
This Repository contains the OKTA APIs that are scripted via Python to automate and do multiple tasks. Some of the scripts do use excel sheet for inupt and output so that bulk activites on users and groups can be done easily. This is still under construction so do not use it still. I will remove this comment once it is ready to use or almost ready.
